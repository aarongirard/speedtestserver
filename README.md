# speedtestserver
flask, sqlite3, d3

This is my first time using Flask to build a server. It is mostly practice, but I am also 
using it to build a service that will allow me to record my internet speeds (SpeedTestDB.py)
and display them using a flask server with D3 charts (speedtestserver.py). It was also a chance to 
learn how to host a website on my raspberry pi that is open to the public (setting up static IP and configuring
router, etc).
